# Welcome to my blog

## whoami

My name is Nicholas Domanico. I am a Christian, cybersecurity student, animal lover, Linux enthusiast, and a few other things.

I've never liked talking much about myself personally, so I'll jump straight to what I will be talking about:

## Purpose of this blog

I'll probably be writing about all kinds of things in this blog, but will focus primarily on Linux and security concepts. Ill discus my journey getting started in Bug Bounty hunting, learning networking concepts in a homelab, Linux command line tools, scripting, etc.
